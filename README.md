# Youtube_Harvesting
This project involves creating a Streamlit application for harvesting and warehousing data from multiple YouTube channels. The application offers a user-friendly interface for users to access, analyze, and store data from these channels. The data is stored in a MySQL database for structured data and a MongoDB database for unstructured data.
